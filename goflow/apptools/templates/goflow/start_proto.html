<h1>Default start application</h1>
<h2>process: {{process_name}}</h2>
This default start application is useful for testing a workflow process without any code.
It starts a new instance of a <i>DefaultAppModel</i> object, which has only one
TextField field. This text field
is used to log the instance history, and all the comments that the workflow users
will add at each step.
<p>
Typically a process is first built with activities and transitions, but
the application fields in activities are left blank;
the default application (<i>default_app</i>)
will then be executed for each manual activity: this is a simple form that displays:
<ul>
<li> the instance history
<li> a description of the current activity, so you can simulate it
<li> a text field that you should use to enter comments; these will be logged in the history.
<li> as many submit buttons as outer transitions with conditions.
</ul>
