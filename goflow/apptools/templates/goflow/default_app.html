<h1>default application</h1>
This default application is used when <i>application field</i> of the current
activity is not set.<br>
It is useful for prototyping a workflow, and playing with it without making
any complex task like python code.<br>
Consider this panel as a simulation for you workflo: the activity is described below,
and a comment can be inserted.
<h2>activity: {{ activity.title }}</h2>
description:
<br><pre>{{ activity.description }}
</pre>
<h2>Instance history</h2>
(The instance history allows to test and debug the workflow)
<pre>{{history}}</pre>
<h3>Add comments in history</h3>
<form method="post">
     {% csrf_token %}
<table>
{{ form }}
</table>
The buttons below are automatically generated given conditions on
outer transitions from the current activity (default: OK and Cancel):<br> 
{% for v in submit_values %}
<input type="submit" name='action' value='{{ v }}'>
{% endfor %}
</form>
{% endblock %}
